            <p>Welcome to my Crypto app made in React. 
                While I wanted to reacreate an older Project the API I used before is no longer working and
                 I've yet to find one with the info needed. I hope you can enjoy the work put into making this 
                layout. I will be grabbing the information of Crypto currencies in the U.S for now.</p>
        </div>
